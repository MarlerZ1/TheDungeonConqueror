# TheDungeonConqueror
This work was performed in the first half of the first year of undergraduate studies at the university to receive an excellent grade without passing an exam. This is my first test in object-oriented programming in c++. It would be good to rewrite it taking into account the inheritance of fields and methods from the parent class.  The essence of the game is that the player is given a choice: attack, fight back, escape, restore mana (if the mage class is selected). The game implements saving progress when getting a new level to a file.
